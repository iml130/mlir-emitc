# MLIR EmitC

![Build and test](https://github.com/iml130/mlir-emitc/workflows/Build%20and%20test/badge.svg)

EmitC is a MLIR dialect to emit C++ code. The initial checked in code is forked from https://reviews.llvm.org/D76571.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a research project and not intended for everyday use. The code is made available without any support. However, we welcome any kind of feedback via the issue tracker.

EmitC enables to convert operations from other MLIR dialects to [EmitC ops](docs/EmitC.md) and to translate those to C++.


## Getting Started
### Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iml130/mlir-emitc.git
cd mlir-emitc
git submodule update --init
```

### Build and Run

The setup assumes that you have built LLVM and MLIR in `$BUILD_DIR` and installed them to `$PREFIX`. You can use the `build_tools/build.sh` shell script to configure, build and install LLVM and MLIR.

To build and launch the tests, run
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ .. -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX/lib/cmake/mlir -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$BUILD_DIR/bin/llvm-lit
cmake --build . --target check-emitc
```

**Note**: If don't use `build_tools/build.sh`, make sure to pass `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` when building LLVM with CMake in order to install `FileCheck` to the chosen installation prefix.

To additionally build and execute the unittests, run
```shell
cmake --build . --target MLIREmitCAllTests
./unittests/MLIREmitCAllTests
```


## Supported Conversions and Translations

Conversions are supported for [MLIR-HLO](https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir-hlo) ops and some ops of the standard and SCF dialect.
The `emitc-opt` tool enables conversions via the following options:

| option                                   |                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--convert-mhlo-region-ops-to-emitc `    | Convert MHLO operations containing regions to EmitC dialect.    |
| `--convert-mhlo-to-emitc `               | Convert from MHLO dialect to EmitC dialect.                     |
| `--convert-scf-to-emitc`                 | Convert SCF dialect to EmitC dialect, replacing IfOp and ForOp. |
| `--convert-std-to-emitc `                | Convert std dialect to EmitC dialect, replacing IndexCastOp.    |

The currently supported MHLO ops are listed in the [docs/mhlo-op-coverage.md](docs/mhlo-op-coverage.md) document.

Furthermore, the `emitc-opt` tools supports the conversion from `mhlo.constant` to `constant` via `--convert-mhlo-const-to-std `. This conversion is necessary because EmitC does not implement a conversion from `mhlo.constant`, but does support `constant` in the translation to C++.

After converting to EmitC, C++ code can be emited using `emitc-translate --mlir-to-cpp`.
